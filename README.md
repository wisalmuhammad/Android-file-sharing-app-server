# Android File Sharing

Apps often have a need to offer one or more of their files to another app. For example, an image gallery may want to offer files to image editors, or a file management app may want to allow users to copy and paste files between areas in external storage. One way a sending app can share a file is to respond to a request from the receiving app.
